## Winter Game
Another attempt at an engine. C was getting tedious because I needed something similar to C++ templates but not C++ templates lmao. So I stored types in a table and printed them to a file. It was getting tiring maintaining it because this wasn't a full fledged metaprogrammer, but a very basic one. I started work on one - basically store source code in an AST but I really just want to make a game lol. Now we use The Language. I am not very good at it and I skimmed through a lot of details. Hopefully with enough experience, things will make more sense.

Anyways, the goal is to make a 1 - 2 hr demo. I have an insane amount of work to do irl so I can devote only sometime each day, however, that time will likely have substantial value since I have the potential to be more productive in this language.

### Build
Only builds on windows and linux for now. It uses opengl 4.5 now and until I am done with the game, I am not making a vulkan backend.
